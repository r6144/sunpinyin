Todo:

    * make slm and sunpinyin-ime-core available as shared libraries
    * add API and UI for user-defined words
    * support Traditional Chinese, dict and corpus
    * support fuzzy Pinyin and more Pinyin schemes, such as double-pinyin
    * more configuration options, such as keybindings, number of candidates per page etc.
    * improve the candidate selecting for user selections
    * new language bindings for slm, such as Java, and Ruby
    * leverage Sogou's dict and corpus

    * more efficient focus handling in the history cache; use something similar to the 1/x model for history weighting.
    
    * 的 has a huge ts in the language model (e.g. in 欣喜地, the third character can be 的 with
      ts=0.178), so the history-derived probability of 地 must be at least as high in order to beat
      it.  However, only the 0.68 fraction of that probability is useful, and that probability is
      further diluted by other possible words (including DCWID) that could follow.  Currently we
      simply increase the history power to the maximum (0.50), but maybe it is better to adjust the
      weighting algorithm of the different probabilities, at least to account for the priors
      properly.
    
In process:

    * Python binding for SunPinyin's SLM [80%]

Done:

    * fix the multi-phonetic bug in pytrie
    * porting to SCIM platform
    * porting to Mac OS X
