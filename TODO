Todo:

    * make slm and sunpinyin-ime-core available as shared libraries
    * add API and UI for user-defined words
    * support Traditional Chinese, dict and corpus
    * support fuzzy Pinyin and more Pinyin schemes, such as double-pinyin
    * more configuration options, such as keybindings, number of candidates per page etc.
    * improve the candidate selecting for user selections
    * new language bindings for slm, such as Java, and Ruby
    * leverage Sogou's dict and corpus
    
    * check for memory leaks
    
    * save the user history more regularly (not just at IC destroy time) and reliably (avoid races
      between different IM engine instances running in the same directory, although this should
      indicate a misconfiguration).  We can then increase the history size as well.

In process:

    * Python binding for SunPinyin's SLM [80%]

Done:

    * fix the multi-phonetic bug in pytrie
    * porting to SCIM platform
    * porting to Mac OS X
